# telegraf-processors-examples-rearrange-tables

Telegraf **processors** examples on how to rearrange tables/measurements for InfluxDB.

## Status

Work in progress. Not yet finished.

---

## Disclaimer

The examples were mostly tried out under `Windows 10`, with `Telegraf 1.17.x` and `InfluxDB 2.0.x`.
Under other operating systems or versions of Telegraf/InfluxDB, deviations may occur under certain circumstances.

This repo only shows *examples* and does *not* represent an all-round carefree solution. The examples have not been tested extensively. It may contain errors.
The examples may need to be adapted to individual requirements.

If something does not work, tinker with it yourself.

If you find a bug or have an addition, please write an issue or submit a pull request.
